An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory.

# ðŸ§  Key Array Operations (and Real Analogies):
| Operation        | Real-World Analogy                      | Complexity |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Access `arr[i]`  | Grab egg from a fixed slot              | `O(1)`     |
| Search           | Scan through all eggs for a cracked one | `O(n)`     |
| Insert at end    | Add new egg at end of tray (if room)    | `O(1)`     |
| Insert in middle | Shift eggs to fit a new one             | `O(n)`     |
| Delete by value  | Remove all rotten eggs                  | `O(n)`     |
