## 🚀 Getting Started (Python)

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/project-based-dsa.git
   cd project-based-dsa/python
   ```

2. Use Python 3.8+  
3. Each folder includes:
   - 📄 `*.py` files: implementation
   - 🧪 `dry_runs.md`: walkthrough examples
   - 📘 `leetcode_problems.md`: handpicked problems
   - 🧠 `reflection.md`: learning notes

## 🧠 Learning Workflow

1. 📚 Read the topic explanation
2. ✏️ Dry-run brute-force & optimal code
3. ⚙️ Solve 3–5 LeetCode-style problems
4. 🧪 Build the mini-project
5. 📌 Take a quiz & log reflections
